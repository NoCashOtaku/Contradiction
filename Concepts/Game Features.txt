Anyone, yet No One
(OR: Many I am called, but not many I am)

- Plot
    - The main protagonist is a... well, you don't know what it is. And neither does the protagonist.
      The only time the game is in First Person Perspective is when you control it.
    - The protagonist can not remember what it is, but finds it may recover memories by interacting with the people.
    - One problem - it can't. Instead, it must temporarily assume the roles of everyone.
    - Prologue ends when main character interacts with anyone.
    - The thing will eventually regain enough memories to recall what it is.
    - It encounters something that will restore it back to the original state.
    - The it is a she?
    

- Nonlinear Storyline
    - Story broke up into characters, then broke up into chapters which can be changed by "divergences".
    - You can switch characters at any time - you can play ANY character.
    - Decisions you make in the chapters of some characters can effect the fates of others.
    - A "chapter" is a measurement of time for a single character. This being said, A character in chapter 6 is
      furthur in time then one in chapter 2.
    - Events that change fate are decided by the character who has progressed more through time, and the character(s)
      that have been effected may have their stories change to force the event to happen. For example, if the blacksmith
      calls the shopkeep to the woods and kills him, the shopkeep must go to the woods in his story.
    - The game unlocks the main character after a set amount of chapters have passed. The game ends when the main character's
      final chapter is attained.
