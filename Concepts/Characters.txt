- Characters
    - YOU. Shown as ??? until your proper end. You exist as an entity, but you have no physical composition. Who are you?
    - The Deus Ex Machina, or the God of the Machine. The one actually responsible for your misfortunes, but (s)he may have
      better intentions then you think.
    - Dren, the barkeep. Age 34. Married to the waitress Shella and has a child named Kelly. Having fought for his
      country for 10 awful years, he suffers from paranoia and can be scared from his regulars when they are drunk.
    - Shella, the waitress. Age 29. Met Dren during the war and was his superior. Often dotes over Kelly a little too much,
      and attracts over half the men at the bar.... until she points to her (a little scary) husband.
    - Kelly. Age 8. The child of Dren and Shella. She is somehow better at creating cocktails than her father, despite
      not drinking any of them. One of the most optimistic of the town. *hinamatsuri
    - Kirk, the elder shopkeep. Age 73. Have survived two terrible wars, but his age has finally caught up to him. Although
      he tries to be as upbeat as possible, he isn't doing to well. Suffers from tuberculosis.
    - Ben, the younger shopkeep. Age 24. Caretaker of his grandfather, Kirk. Although he tries to help his grandfather
      as much as possible, he can not stand seeing his grandfather in pain from his ailments. Has a crush on Lesse.
    - Lesse, the teacher. Age 27. Caring of the students, she tries not only to teach her students what is on the nation's
      curiculum, but also many practical skills on how to succeed in life. Extraordinally dense.
    - Brent, the mayor. Age 67. Tries his best to improve the town, but can never seem to get enough funding to do so. Suspects
      someone is pocketing some of the tax revenues. Extremely protective of his grandchild, Erik, as he lost the rest of his
      family in the last war. Missing his left arm.
    - Steve, the mayor's aide. Age 17. Seemingly optimistic, he may be hiding something...
    - Erik. Age 7. Brent's grandchild. Likes playing war games, much to his grandfather's discontent. Desires to become a hero
      "like his dad". Orphaned at the age of 3.
    - Colt, the blacksmith. Age 44. Deals with all the town's metalwork, but is sometimes a bit too passionate. Also a
      pyromaniac. To this day, the other still wonder how he can live with Cathleen, the village slacker.
    - Cathleen, the messenger. Age 42. Responsible for delivering messages. Despite the fact that the town rarely sends mail,
      the lag times are equivalent to the most loaded carriers in the largest cities. Very lazy, but she and her husband
      create devices to make her job even lazier.
    - Benton, the lord. Age 36. He holds sovereignty over the village, but he leaves all affairs to Brent. Though he is a lord,
      he certainly does not dress like one. Maried to Grace and has a child named Lucy. Other lords do not like him.
    - Grace, the lady. Age 30. Although she may seem serene and regal, she makes the most lewd insinuations. Probably a
      terrible influence on Lucy, but she simply "does not give a shit". 
    - Lucy. Age 8. The child of the nobles. She has inherited her mother's tongue and is a master of debates, having intimidated
      a team of her kidnappers solely by speaking to them. The most rational and wary of the children.
    - Keller, the butler. Age 34. Maried to Helen and the father of Reflet. Though he appears courteous, he is the second most
      wary of the estate, being beaten only by Lucy. Unfortunately, his awareness does not prevent him from tripping all over
      the place. He is a genius inventor, and has created a surveilance system using mirrors to watch over the estate.
    - Helen, the maid. Age 32. Incredibly capable as a servant, but more so as a commander. When the village is in danger,
      she is responsible for leading the soldiers. However, no matter how strong she seems, Reflet always manages to bring out
      her sweet side.
    - add reflet here
    - John, the priest. Age 53. The maintainer of the new church. Following the events of the past war, he is severely depressed
      and despite his position, visits the bar frequently. But no one blames him as he is the only one alive out of the 12 staff.
    - Catherine, the explorer. Age 41. She leaves the village often in search for new trade routes and newer lands. Also skilled
      as a thief as she has stolen from bandits more than once.
    - Robin, the thief. Age 39. People scold him for helping his wife raid bandits to return the money to the victims, but he
      cares not. Although he does not have the cleanest past relating to nobles, Benton doesn't mind, as he got to see Keller's
      surveillance system in use.
    - Riding Hood (A.K.A. Emily). Age 13. The most silent of the townspeople, but has inherited her father's kindness. Although
      Robin  boasts about it, the townspeople rarely see it as she never seems to be around....
    - Trent, the mechanic. Age 22. Best friends with Colt and Keller, and is currently dating Margaret. Although one of the
      youngest in the last war, he has created the most ingenious weaponry that has saved the lives of the town. However, it is
      often said that every full moon, an explosion occurs in his basement. *does he avoid silver? *needs more "tells"
    - Margaret, the doctor. Age 23. Met Trent after he got injured in one of his infamous explosions. Although she complains
      about his lack of care, having treated him an absurd times a year, she can not get enough of his sleeping face. As she
      owns the hospital, she provides the medicine for everyone.
    - Brenna, the knight. Age 33. She tries her hardest to stop the town from being harmed from crime, but has difficulty
      doing so. She also posesses the position as judge of the land, and tries to maintain law and order. Currently trying to
      investigate a possible tax scandal. NOTE: Brenna is special as she may only be controlled after a crime has taken place.

Divergences:
    - [a,b] denotes the chapter of the pereffecter and the effectee.
    - Routes are denoted with a letter. 
    - You and the Deus Ex Machina do not directly effect the others' chapter sequnce.
    - Dren (Barkeep) + John (Priest) - > John may die.
    - Colt (Blacksmith) is destined to have an accident with fire. Who gets hurt in the accident depends on Colt's relation
      with Trent. If they are enemies, both will die in a fire. If they are friends, one of them will die. If they do not
      have any significant interaction, Cathleen will be permanently blinded/crippled by the fire, forcing her to do less
      than ever. (SEE the irony?)
    - If Steve is caught (depends on choices in Steve, Brenna, Brent routes) = life sentance
      If Erik tries to stop him, he will be murdered but Steve will be caught = Public Execution by Brenna
    - Catherine or Robin die during a raid (Same chapter in both routes, the choice is shown in the first played, fate
      determined in the second played)
    - If Margaret is not careful, she will die in an explosion and Trent will be arrested.
      Tips on how to survive Margaret route are hidden in Trent's path, but are not necessary for her to survive.
      If you are stupid enough, Margaret may still die in Trent's path (READ: VERY STUPID).
    - Kirk will die in one of the multitude of ways, but can cause Lesse or Ben to have a more tragic end before doing so.
      - Kirk may die in peace if Ben shows Lesse to Kirk as Ben's girlfriend. However, Kirk dies that very night, and
        Ben and Lesse fall out the next morning since Ben becomes extremely depressed.
      - If Ben and Lesse start dating while Kirk is alive, Lesse is set to die from a case of tuberculosis. This is because
        Lesse did not know Kirk had it when she visited him.
      - If Kirk dies and Ben does not confess before a certain chapter, he will commit suicide.
      - If Kirk dies and Ben and Lesse start dating after, they will survive if not killed off by other character/events or
        stupidity.
      - Kirk doesn't die. He is actually the Deus Ex Machina all along. (This is most likely a joke divergence).
